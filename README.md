### Setting up

1. Add your applications to the container using a Dockerfile or mount as a volume to `/www/{{ app_name }}`.
2. Take a look at php.ini, change the session storage cache if you do not like Redis on `tcp://cache_server:6379`
3. If you want to use `Wolnosciowiec Notification Client` then put your configuration at `/www/.notificationrc`
4. After running containers you have to run provision manually via `docker exec -it {{ container_id }} /provision-on-deployment.sh`
5. Add your crontab tasks to `/etc/crontabs/production` so it will be executed as production user
6. Connect nginx or Apache 2 or lighttpd or other webserver to the FPM on `9000` port exposed by the container
